# Purpose

Learning was the main purpose, and I've learned some stuff. This is just a study project, maybe I'll try implementing something even more complete and logically correct now that I know a little bit more about the starting points.

# Planning

- Cryptographic hash: keccak256;
- Digital signature: Ed25519;
- Immutable ledger: merkle trie (LevelDB as the underlying storage);
- P2P network: with tokio and etc;
- Consensus algorithm: Proof of Work (PoW);
- Block validation: Mining;
